# Enrollment Management Integration

This document describes the new enrollment management functionality that has been integrated into the frontend to support the updated backend API.

## Overview

The frontend now supports the new professor student management API that allows:

- **Professors** to manage students in classes they teach
- **Admins** to manage students in any class
- **Students** to enroll/unenroll themselves (self-service)
- Secure role-based access control

## New Components

### 1. ClaseStudentManagement.svelte

A comprehensive component for managing student enrollments in classes. Features:

- Display enrolled students with pagination
- Remove students from classes (for professors/admins)
- Integration with available students modal
- Success/error message handling
- Role-based access control

### 2. AvailableStudentsModal.svelte

A modal component for browsing and enrolling available students. Features:

- Paginated list of available students
- Filter out already enrolled students
- Direct enrollment functionality
- Responsive design

## Updated Services

### ClaseService

Added new methods:

- `enrollStudentInClass(alumnoId: number, claseId: number)`: Enroll a student in a class
- `unenrollStudentFromClass(alumnoId: number, claseId: number)`: Remove a student from a class
- `contarAlumnosEnClase(claseId: number)`: Count students in a class

### AlumnoService

Added new method:

- `getAvailableStudents(params)`: Get available students for enrollment

## Security Model

The frontend implements the same security model as the backend:

1. **Role-based access control**:

   - Only professors and admins can manage enrollments
   - Students can only enroll/unenroll themselves

2. **Class ownership validation**:

   - Professors can only manage students in classes they teach
   - Admins can manage students in any class

3. **UI-level security**:
   - Management buttons only appear for authorized users
   - Error messages for unauthorized actions

## Usage

### For Professors

1. Navigate to a class they teach
2. Click "Gestionar Inscripciones" button
3. Browse available students in the modal
4. Click the "+" icon to enroll a student
5. Use the trash icon to remove enrolled students

### For Admins

1. Navigate to any class
2. Use the same management interface as professors
3. Can manage students in any class

### For Students

1. Navigate to any class
2. Use the enrollment button to enroll/unenroll themselves
3. Cannot manage other students

## API Integration

The frontend uses the following new API endpoints:

- `GET /api/alumnos/disponibles` - Get available students
- `POST /api/clases/enrollment` - Enroll a student
- `DELETE /api/clases/enrollment` - Unenroll a student
- `GET /api/clases/{claseId}/alumnos` - Get students in a class
- `GET /api/clases/{claseId}/alumnos/contar` - Count students in a class

## Error Handling

The frontend handles various error scenarios:

- Student not found
- Class not found
- Permission denied
- Student already enrolled
- Student not enrolled
- Network errors

All errors are displayed to the user with appropriate messages.

## UI/UX Features

- **Loading states**: Spinners during API calls
- **Success messages**: Confirmation of successful operations
- **Error messages**: Clear error feedback
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large student lists
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Modal dialogs**: Clean interface for enrollment management
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Prevent accidental student removal

## Integration Points

The new functionality is integrated into:

- Class detail page (`/clases/[id]`)
- Replaces the old `ClaseStudents` component
- Uses existing authentication and authorization system
- Maintains consistency with existing UI patterns

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Bulk enrollment operations
- Search and filtering in available students modal
- Email notifications for enrollment changes
- Enrollment statistics and analytics
- Advanced student management features
