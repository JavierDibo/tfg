# Payment Admin Features Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of admin payment management features for the Academia App, allowing administrators to view all payments and filter by student ID.

## Requirements Met

### 1. Admin View All Payments
- **Requirement**: As an admin I want to be able to see all pagos, including the date and hour, their id, method and status.
- **Implementation**: 
  - New admin payment management page at `/pagos/admin`
  - Comprehensive table showing all payment details
  - Pagination support for large datasets
  - Sorting capabilities on all columns
  - Real-time statistics dashboard

### 2. Admin View Student Payments
- **Requirement**: As an admin I want to be able to see the pagos of a particular student using their id.
- **Implementation**:
  - Student ID filter in admin interface
  - Direct API endpoint for student-specific payments
  - Seamless switching between all payments and filtered view

## Backend Implementation

### New Service Methods
- `obtenerTodosLosPagos(Pageable pageable)` - Get all payments with pagination
- `obtenerPagosPorAlumno(String alumnoId, Pageable pageable)` - Get payments by student ID

### New Repository Methods
- `findByAlumnoIdOrderByFechaPagoDesc(String alumnoId, Pageable pageable)` - Paginated student payments

### New REST Endpoints
- `GET /api/pagos` - Enhanced to return all payments for admin view
- `GET /api/pagos/alumno/{alumnoId}` - Get payments for specific student

## Frontend Implementation

### New Components
1. **Admin Payment Management Page** (`/pagos/admin/+page.svelte`)
   - Comprehensive payment table with all required fields
   - Student ID filtering
   - Pagination controls
   - Sorting on all columns
   - Statistics dashboard

2. **Payment Detail Page** (`/pagos/[id]/+page.svelte`)
   - Detailed view of individual payments
   - Security-based access control
   - Complete payment information display

3. **Common Components**
   - `Pagination.svelte` - Reusable pagination component
   - `ErrorDisplay.svelte` - Enhanced error display with backward compatibility

### Enhanced Service Methods
- `getAllPayments()` - Get all payments for admin view
- `getPaymentsByStudentId()` - Get payments filtered by student ID

## Features Implemented

### Payment Table Columns
- **ID**: Unique payment identifier
- **Date & Time**: Full timestamp of payment
- **Amount**: Payment amount in EUR
- **Method**: Payment method (Stripe, Cash, Bank Transfer)
- **Status**: Payment status with color coding
- **Student ID**: Associated student identifier
- **Actions**: View details button

### Filtering & Sorting
- **Student ID Filter**: Enter student ID to filter payments
- **Column Sorting**: Click any column header to sort
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large datasets
- **Clear Filters**: Easy reset to view all payments

### Security & Access Control
- **Role-based Access**: Only ADMIN users can access admin view
- **Payment Detail Security**: Admin/Professor can view any payment, students only their own
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT token

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during data loading
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error display
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Quick overview of payment data
- **Navigation**: Easy navigation between views

## API Endpoints

### Get All Payments (Admin)
```
GET /api/pagos?page=0&size=20&sortBy=fechaPago&sortDirection=DESC
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

### Get Student Payments
```
GET /api/pagos/alumno/{studentId}?page=0&size=20&sortBy=fechaPago&sortDirection=DESC
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

### Get Payment Details
```
GET /api/pagos/{paymentId}
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. Navigate to `/pagos` and click "Admin View" button
2. View all payments in the comprehensive table
3. Use the student ID filter to view specific student payments
4. Click "View Details" to see complete payment information
5. Use pagination and sorting to navigate large datasets

### Access Control
- **ADMIN**: Full access to all payment data and admin features
- **PROFESOR**: Can view payment details but no admin interface
- **ALUMNO**: Can only view their own payments

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Frontend requests payment data via service layer
2. Service layer calls backend API endpoints
3. Backend validates authentication and authorization
4. Database queries return paginated results
5. Frontend displays data with sorting and filtering

### Performance Considerations
- Pagination implemented to handle large datasets
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Lazy loading of payment details
- Optimized frontend rendering with Svelte 5

### Security Measures
- JWT token validation on all endpoints
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through JPA repositories

## Future Enhancements
- Export functionality for payment reports
- Advanced filtering (date ranges, status, amount ranges)
- Bulk operations for payment management
- Real-time payment status updates
- Payment analytics and reporting dashboard
